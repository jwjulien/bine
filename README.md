Vine Markdown Editor
========================================================================================================================
This simple tool was designed to make editing Markdown files a little bit more comfortable.

One of the best parts about Markdown is that it's **just TEXT** which is awesome for the portability but not so great when it comes to editing large files.  Enter: vine.

This tool does not establish any new standards - it simply just presents an alternative way of looking at Markdown files be organizing the document structure into a tree using the section headings.
