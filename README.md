Bine Markdown Editor
========================================================================================================================
An extension of the Vine Markdown editing tool to specifically support working with checklists in Markdown format.

I have a personal obsession with checklists (The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem).  Also, the way that I like to prepare and look forward to a vacation is to daydream about being there and ponder everything that I think I may need, adding things to packing lists.

Over the years, I have created many bespoke tools to handle lists both online and offline and none of them have been overly ideal.  The more recent flavor has used Markdown checklists in a folder that I can use version control on what has solved issues with searching but I have lost features like progress bars and compartmentalization.  That's where this tool comes in.

Bine aims to be a simple tool that:

- Stores data in nicely formatted Markdown files that can be hand edited just the same.
- Provides spell checking on the text inputs.
- Sorts lists alphabetically so that version control can better merge multiple lists.
- Provides support for nested lists in a tree structure.
- Shows progress bars indicating the percentage complete for each node.
